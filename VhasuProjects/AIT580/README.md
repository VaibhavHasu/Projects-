# Mental Health Care Analysis – Last 4 Weeks

## Overview
This project analyzes mental health care trends in the United States using survey data collected from August 2020 onwards. The aim is to understand how individuals accessed mental health services such as therapy, counseling, and prescription medication, and how these patterns vary across age groups, income levels, and geographic regions. The project focuses on identifying disparities in access to mental health care and observing changes over time, especially during and after the COVID-19 period.

## Objectives
1) Analyze trends in mental health care usage over time

2) Identify demographic gaps in access to services

3) Compare mental health care availability across different states

4) Study the impact of socioeconomic factors

5) Provide insights that can support better healthcare policies and decisions

## Dataset
Source: Data.gov – Mental Health Care in the Last 4 Weeks

Includes:
1) Prescription medication usage

2) Counseling or therapy participation

3) Age groups and income levels

4) Geographic/state-level data

5) Time periods and confidence intervals

## Tools & Technologies Used
1) Python – Data cleaning and visualization

	1) Pandas

	2) Matplotlib

	3) Seaborn

2) R – Statistical analysis and trend evaluation

3) SQL – Data extraction and integration

4) Jupyter Notebook – Development environment

## Methodology
1) Data Preprocessing

	1) Handling missing values

	2) Formatting date and time columns

	3) Combining confidence intervals

2) Statistical Analysis

	1) Mean, median, and standard deviation

	2) Trend analysis across time periods

	3) Confidence interval evaluation

3) Visualization

	1) Bar charts and comparative graphs

	2) State-wise service availability

	3) Demographic trend comparisons

## Key Findings
1) Mental health concerns such as anxiety and depression vary significantly across demographics and regions.

2) States like California, Texas, and New York show comparatively higher availability of mental health services.

3) Lower-income and rural populations experience higher unmet mental health needs.

4) Telehealth services played an important role in improving accessibility after the pandemic.

## Conclusion
The analysis highlights clear disparities in mental health care access across states, income levels, and demographic groups. Improved policy support, funding allocation, and expansion of telehealth services are essential to ensure equitable mental health care access for all communities.
